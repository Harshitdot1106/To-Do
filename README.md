# Advanced React To-Do Application with API Integration

This project is a responsive and feature-rich To-Do application built using React, Redux, and integrated with a public API. It demonstrates advanced state management, API integration, user authentication, and responsive design principles.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Add Task:** Input a task in a text field and add it to the list using a button or by pressing `Enter`.
- **View Tasks:** Display all tasks in a structured list format.
- **Delete Task:** Remove a task from the list with a delete button.
- **Task Prioritization:** Set and display task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Persistent Storage:** Save tasks and authentication status using local or session storage.

### Additional Features
